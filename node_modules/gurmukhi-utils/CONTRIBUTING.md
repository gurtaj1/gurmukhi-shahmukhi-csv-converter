## Getting Started

If you wish to better understand how Gurmukhi Utils works or want to debug an issue: get the source, build it, and run it locally.

### Prerequisites

In order to download necessary tools, clone the repository, and install dependencies, you'll need network access.

Youâ€™ll need the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) (If you need to manage multiple Node.JS versions, [use a node version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install)

Get the source code of `gurmukhi-utils` repo:

```
gh repo fork shabados/gurmukhi-utils --clone=true
```

**PROTIP**: Use the [`gh` cli tool from GitHub](https://cli.github.com/) to fork the repo to your GitHub account (if not already), clone it to your local machine, and set the appropriate remotes for origin and upstream with the above command.

### Build

Run `npm i` in the root directory.

### Run

Usage:

```
npm run <command>
```

The commands are:

```
build-docs Generates docs from readme.hbs and jsdoc
lint Runs ESLint
test Unit tests with Jest
```

### Notes

Markdown and HTML JSDoc documentation is generated automatically on commit. If you'd like to preview any changes to documentation, `npm run build-docs` will update `README.md` and the files in `docs/`. `README.md` should _not_ be edited, instead apply modifications to `README.hbs`.

_Note to contributors with push access to main:_ Any commits or merge commits containing the strings `#Major`, `#Minor`, `#Patch` (case-sensitive) will trigger an automatic npm release with the respective semver bump.

## Workflow

The workflow of development (or Git Flow) is to [choose/create an issue](https://github.com/ShabadOS/presenter/issues) to work on, [create a feature branch](https://github.com/ShabadOS/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute#branches), and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ShabadOS/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute#pull-requests).

**PROTIP**: Read more about our workflow (issue tracking, branching, and pull requests) in the [How To Contribute wiki article](https://github.com/ShabadOS/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
